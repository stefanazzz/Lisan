## Code used to generate figures 10- b,c,d of manuscript "Off-fault damage controls near-surface rupture behaviour in soft sediments" 

- The manucript is under review in Nature Communications as of Nov. 26, 2024. (reference number: NCOMMS-24-75893). Authors: Nicola De Paola, Rachael J. Bullock, Robert E. Holdsworth, Shmuel Marco, and Stefan Nielsen. 

- The coding is in Mathematica&copy; (Wolfram)
- It runs on Mathematica 13.2 (also most likely on any previous Mathematica release > 10, although I have not tested it)  
- Three versions are provided
  - Mathematica&copy; notebook
  - Mathematica&copy; .m file
  - Mathematica&copy .pdf file (pdf version of the notebook)

- The code defines equations for
  - stress intensity
  - static fracture energy
  - energy flow as a function of rupture velocity
    
- Then the code  
  - uses the energy flow equation to compute rupture velocity as a function of position on an indealised earthquake fault model
  - plots the solution for different scenarios
